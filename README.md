## I am building this to add to my portfolio
### Let's break it down
1. This is oop, I have a class for cards, players and house. The cards hold value and get stored in a list named deck. The players take turns taking hits and staying. All the game logic is done by the House because that's who would do it in a real cassino.

2. Im not sure where I'm goin with this, I might make it a webgame in the future or possably a compiled pygame. As of [now] (Sept. 23, 2024), it's an unfinished terminal game.
